# Emotion-Classification-Project
This project builds and evaluates a machine-learning pipeline for text emotion classification. It applies noise cleaning, negation-aware stopword handling, lemmatization and stemming, then uses TF-IDF features with multiple classifiers. A tuned linear SVM performs best and produces emotion labels for unseen data.
