Steps: 
1. Put the below files to your working directory, e.g "G:\My Drive\MSc. in Data Science\\Assignments\AS3_Sentiment_Classification"
	- requirements.txt 
	- scr_modules folder 
	- main.ipynb
	- train.csv 
	- test.csv (your file with the unknown labels)
2. Open a Command Prompt from your terminal and execute the below: 
	- Change your current directory to the one you put the files
          Example in our case: 
		cd /d "G:\My Drive\MSc. in Data Science\\Assignments\AS3_Sentiment_Classification"

		pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the main.ipynb and start executing the code section by section. 	


Notes: 
 - The algorithm will take about 3-4 minutes to execute.
 - The EDA_&_Preprocessing_Analysis_of_Data.ipynb is to demonstrate the analysis we did before proceeding to modeling.
